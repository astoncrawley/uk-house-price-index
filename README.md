# 🏡 UK Housing Market Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This project analyses UK housing price trends from 1995–2025 using publicly available data from the His Majesty's Land Registry (HM Land Registry). The goal is to identify regional differences in house price growth and build a simple regression model to forecast future prices. Interactive charts and visualisations are provided to support decision-making.
